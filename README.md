The purpose of this project is to use the skills I have learnt during The Odin Project to recreate an existing website.

I accomplished this by doing the following:
1. Analyse the page to understand it's DOM
2. Create the base structure of the HTML
3. Analyse the styling
4. Create the base styling
5. Use the inspector tool to touch up and finalise the page.
